# Time Yourself
#### Track time for what you're doing. Don't waste your time!
#### Some kind of a stopwatch to track your time.
#### Used kivy 1.10.0 for GUI.

With this program you can add any amount of stopwatches to track how much time do you use for learning or sleeping or procrastinating. Sit back and watch how your time goes by :)

- To use it just install requirements and run main.py in python.

- You can download windows version from <a href="https://nofile.io/f/XP9GWVQZKvv/timeyourself.zip">here</a>, unzip archive and open `TimeYourself.exe`. No python needed for this option :)
